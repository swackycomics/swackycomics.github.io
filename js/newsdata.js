					'<p>Hello one and a half people who will most likely read this, welcome to the first post on the SWACKNEWS section of swackycomics. It seems this website keeps getting better and better with each new change. What&#39;s next? A games section?.. It seems more likely than you think.<\/p>',
					'<p>In other news, swackycomics is abandoning serv00. It&#39;s been a great time, but sooner or later this move had to be made. (I didn&#39;t like the long domain name, and it also seemed like they kept putting ads into my website (which I do not approve of)).<\/p>',
					'<p>Stay tuned for more news. I&#39;ll be posting some when the next comic comes out!<\/p>'

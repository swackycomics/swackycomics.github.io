					'<p>Why, hello and welcome to the second news post on the news posting section of swackycomics where the news are, in fact, getting posted. It is I, swackyGCF. And I have come here to announce a BRAND NEW (!!!) comic series. That&#39;s right. It&#39;s SWACKZARDS! Starring none other than two wizards named Styx and Crius. The first comic is available <a href="/comics/swackzards_comics/ep1/" target="_blank">right here</a> if you wanna check it out!</p>',
					'<p>For this one, I wanted to give it a new &quot;style&quot;, so to speak. You can notice some of the things look a bit different from my usual comics. The lineart, the backgrounds, etc etc.</p>',
					'<p>I&#39;ve also tried to give the characters new expressions in each panel, which was partially inspired by Ren &amp; Stimpy&#39;s &quot;never the same face twice&quot; rule, though not to the same extent, obviously.</p>'

					'<p>Hello one and a half people who will most likely read this, welcome to the first post on the SWACKNEWS section of swackycomics. It seems this website keeps getting better and better with each new change. What&#39;s next? A games section?.. It seems more likely than you think.<\/p>',
					'<p>In other news, swackycomics is abandoning serv00. It&#39;s been a great time, but sooner or later this move had to be made. (I didn&#39;t like the long domain name, and it also seemed like they kept putting ads into my website (which I do not approve of)).<\/p>',
					'<p>Stay tuned for more news. I&#39;ll be posting some when the next comic comes out!<\/p>'

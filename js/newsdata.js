					'<p>Why, hello and welcome to the second news post on the news posting section of swackycomics where the news are, in fact, getting posted. It is I, swackyGCF. And I have come here to announce a BRAND NEW (!!!) comic series. That&#39;s right. It&#39;s SWACKZARDS! Starring none other than two wizards named Styx and Crius. The first comic is available <a href="/comics/swackzards_comics/ep1/" target="_blank">right here</a> if you wanna check it out!</p>',

					'<p>I&#39;ve also tried to give the characters new expressions in each panel, which was partially inspired by Ren &amp; Stimpy&#39;s &quot;never the same face twice&quot; rule, though not to the same extent, obviously.</p>'
